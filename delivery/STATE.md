# Pipeline state

The single place that answers "where are we right now". Update it whenever
a phase changes state, a decision is answered, or an owner action becomes
runnable. If this file disagrees with reality, reality wins and this file
is wrong: verify against git and the PR list before trusting it.

- as of: 2026-08-05
- milestone: M1 (walking skeleton), in progress
- plan: `delivery/plan/kernel-plan-v1.md` revision 7, owner-approved
- assurance mode: full (adversarial pipeline). Merge authority is DELEGATED
  to the orchestrator under DR-0012, conditional on dual cross-model clean
  review. Milestone exit-test evidence still goes to the owner regardless.

## How to resume cold

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, then this file.
2. `git fetch origin main` and check what is actually merged.
3. Check open PRs and their CI state.
4. Read the newest files in `delivery/review/` and `delivery/tuition/`;
   they carry the most recent hard-won knowledge.
5. Pick up from the "in flight" section below, using the
   `phase-delivery` skill.

## Phases

| Phase | State | PR | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1-P1 scaffold and CI | merged | #1 | npm scaffold, TypeScript build chain, gates workflow |
| M1-P2 fleet init and doctor | merged | #2 | init as private git repo, doctor with readiness profiles |
| M1-P3 lock and pool | merged | #3 | lease lock, worktree pool; concurrency hardening deferred to M5 |
| M1-P4 spawn and teardown | merged | #6 | carry the criterion-13 meta.json baseOffline clause and P3's holder-identity transport into the brief |
| M1-P5 watcher and liveness | round 4 reviewed, 0 highs, blocked on 2 documentation mediums | PR 8 | tuition T-002 asks that "task open, no turn-end, worktree dirty" become a wake reason |
| M1-P6 toy sandbox and exit test | built ahead, awaiting P5 merge (A-1 now done) | | branch claude/m1-p6-toy-sandbox-exit; sandbox repo tiphys-ai-helmsman-sandbox |

## In flight

**M1-P5 (PR #8): round four reviewed by both contracts. ZERO highs for the
first time in this phase. Blocked on two mediums that close with work-history
edits alone. Owner decides whether that documentation round runs.**

The fix is one implementation of "open a path whose type you have not
established" in `src/task.ts` (`classifyEntry`, `readRegularFileIfPresent`,
`refuseOpenForWrite`), with every reader and writer in the phase routed
through it, plus doctor printing its diagnosis before running the advisory.

Verdicts: hazard contract FIX-ROUND-NEEDED (0 high, 2 medium, 4 low), criteria
contract APPROVE (0 high, 0 medium, 1 low). Arbitration in
`delivery/review/arbitration-m1-p5-round4.md`.

The hazard contract's judgment on the residual is the load-bearing sentence:
ACCEPTABLE AS A RESIDUAL, BLOCKING AS RECORDED. `doctor` and both watcher
modes are now total against this class on every path it could construct, so
the thing that made CR-520 severe, the guard taking down the safety net that
would notice every other hang, is gone.

The two mediums:

- **CR-560**: a TWELFTH path. `mkfifo <fleet>/warnings.md` hangs `tiphys
  spawn` forever with zero output, stranding a worktree, a pool record, a
  branch and the task id. Verified at the source by the orchestrator:
  `src/brief.ts:56` is a bare `readFileSync` gated only by `existsSync`, and
  `src/brief.ts` is not in this phase's diff at all, so it is PRE-EXISTING and
  out of scope. The cause is the third instance of one pattern: the round
  scoped its inventory search to `tasks/`, `state/` and `worktrees/`, and
  `warnings.md` is at the fleet root. A search whose SCOPE is wrong returns an
  empty result that reads exactly like an absence of defects.
- **CR-561**: commit `84dfa41`'s subject claims the probe is a property of
  every read and open. Six unprobed opens remain. Fifth instance of the T-006
  pattern in this phase.

Neither needs a source change. Recording the twelfth path and correcting the
record is the honest close; fixing it means editing another phase's file.

Both contracts independently confirmed: the gate numbers on both toolchains
exactly (Node 26 gives 146/146/0 skipped, Node 22 gives 146/144/2 skipped);
that the CR-540 replacement test is a SOUND witness and not flaky (12/12 and
20/20 red under mutation), which settles the question the orchestrator left
open; the pre-existing `atomicWrite` wake-loss defect against a pristine build
of the previous head; that `randomUUID` is C-2 clean; and the registry
off-by-one, found twice independently and verified a third time by the
orchestrator (145 to 152 keys, so 152 mappings and seven added, not 151 and
six).

Notable low: CR-563 shows the full suite passes with CR-523's ordering fix
REVERTED, so a behavior this round fixed is unguarded. A criteria walk could
not have found that, because no criterion mentions doctor's output ordering.
That is T-007 demonstrated one round after being filed, and it is why the
criteria APPROVE is not treated as decisive.

DECLARED RESIDUAL, unchanged and now more precisely enumerated: `teardown`,
four `lock` subcommands and `spawn` still hang on a FIFO, in `src/lock.ts`,
`src/pool.ts` and `src/brief.ts`. All are M1-P3 and M1-P4 files outside this
phase's authorized set, and a call-site patch would repeat CR-521. Completing
the class across them is real work needing its own scope, not something to
smuggle into a fourth fix round.

**M1-P6: built, pushed, waiting on P5.** Its PR opens once P5 merges. Owner
action A-1 is now DONE, so its full mode is unblocked.

**M2 and M3 plans: revision 1, reviewed, fix rounds applied.** Neither is
delta-reviewed, deliberately, because re-grounding at dispatch is already
required and a second review now would be spent twice. Neither milestone may
dispatch before M1's exit test passes.

## Carried forward, not yet owned

Items discovered during M1 that belong to a later milestone and have no owner
yet. Recorded here so they are not rediscovered the expensive way.

- **Non-atomic task metadata write.** `src/task.ts` writes `meta.json` with a
  plain write, which is the mechanism that produces the torn record the M1-P5
  guard now has to defend against. Out of scope when found and no reviewer
  faulted the phase for it. Real M2 item.
- **Clean presentation of a load-time configuration error.** A malformed
  watcher cadence environment value fails loudly, which is correct, but
  presenting it as a usage error rather than a stack trace needs a top-level
  handler in `bin/tiphys.ts`, a seam no M1 phase owns.
- **M1-P4's inert liveness hook.** Confirmed dead by two reviewers, left in
  place because it is not M1-P5's to delete. Remove it when a phase owns
  `src/spawn.ts`.
- **Deadline-less abandonment.** A task spawned without a deadline is not
  auto-detected as abandoned. The plan's own not-proven list says so for M1;
  it needs an owner in M2 or M4.
- **A mechanism index** mapping a mechanism to the rules this project has
  established for it, per tuition T-005. Belongs with the M3 tuition flow.
- **Complete the unprobed-open class across `src/lock.ts`, `src/pool.ts` and
  `src/brief.ts`.** M1-P5 closed it for the guard, the watcher and doctor on
  every path a reviewer could construct. `teardown`, four `lock` subcommands
  and `spawn` still hang forever on a FIFO, and the spawn case strands a
  worktree, a pool record, a branch and a task id. These are M1-P3 and M1-P4
  files; patching them from M1-P5's call sites would repeat CR-521. Needs its
  own scope, and it is a strong candidate for the mechanism index of T-005.
- **A second review contract per code phase, declared rather than improvised**,
  per tuition T-007. A criteria-walking review cannot find a defect the
  criteria do not describe, which is how a phase met fifteen of fifteen
  executed criteria while live-locking every supervision command. The plan
  schema should carry a phase's hazard classes beside its acceptance criteria
  so the second contract is derivable. M3 role briefs and M3-P1 plan schema.
- **Work-history contract must cover impossibility, coverage and remedy
  claims**, not only universal quantifiers, per tuition T-006. T-003 already
  routed the universal-quantifier rule to M3's report contract; T-006 records
  that the rule as written would have caught none of the three false claims
  M1-P5 produced, because those are existential and causal claims verified by
  CONSTRUCTION rather than by counter-experiment. M3 item, and a reviewer
  checklist item in the same role briefs.

**Re-grounding debt for the M2 and M3 plans.** Both were written in parallel
with M1-P5 and predate T-005 and T-006. DR-0011's recorded consequence makes
re-grounding an explicit step before their delta review. The specific inputs
they have not absorbed are T-005 (mechanism index), T-006 (work-history
contract), DR-0014 (release verification becomes a pluggable interface, which
moves M2-P7's centre of gravity), and M1-P5's own defect record.

## Owner action items

1. **DR-0004 commands, runnable now.** Flip the repository default branch
   to `main` and enable protection requiring a pull request plus the green
   `gates` check. Exact commands in
   `delivery/decisions/DR-0004-elevated-permissions.md`. Until these run,
   nothing structurally prevents a direct push to `main`.
2. **A-1: DONE (owner, 2026-08-05).** The toy sandbox repository is
   https://github.com/ThomasHendrickx/tiphys-ai-helmsman-sandbox. Both M1-P6
   scripts take the repository URL as an argument, so nothing needs editing;
   the URL is supplied at dispatch. M1-P6's full mode is unblocked.
3. **A-2, before M4.** Provide or approve a private remote per real fleet
   home, for fleet-state durability.

## Standing reminders

- Parallelism is on under DR-0011, but MERGE order is still dependency order:
  work may be concurrent, landing may not. A parallel phase's PR never merges
  before the phases its grounding names.
- Milestone exit tests are hard gates, and their evidence goes to the owner
  even while merge authority is delegated.
- A plan written in parallel with implementation is re-grounded against
  everything learned since it was started, as an explicit step BEFORE its
  adversarial review (DR-0011, recorded consequence).
- Process paperwork must reach `main`, not only a side branch. This file
  exists because it once did not.
