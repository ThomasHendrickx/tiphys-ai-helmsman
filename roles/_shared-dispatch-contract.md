# The dispatch contract

THE ONE COPY. Every role brief in `roles/` and `AGENTS.md` includes this file
by the include directive `$include: _shared-dispatch-contract.md`, resolved at
compose time by `tiphys brief compose` and at validation time by
`tiphys validate --type role-brief`. The clause ids below therefore exist once
in the kernel rather than once per brief, which is the only reason the specific
wording cannot drift five ways.

Changing the text below changes every brief that includes it. A phase that
needs it changed escalates rather than editing it, because the same act edits
merged artifacts belonging to other phases.

This file has no frontmatter of its own and is not a role brief. It is never
composed on its own and is never validated as a role brief.

## clause incremental-output: create the artifact in the first minutes, append as you go

Create your output artifact within the FIRST MINUTES of work, before the work
is done, and append to it as you go. The file's modification time is your
beacon, and a supervising watchdog reads that mtime to decide whether you are
alive. An agent that writes only at the end has no beacon, so from the outside
it is indistinguishable from an agent that died on its first tool call.

Write what you just tried, the command you ran, what it printed, what you
concluded, and what you are about to do next. Do not save the write-up for the
end and do not polish it as you go.

THE TRIGGER, so that this is something you can check rather than something you
have to remember, because remembering is what a busy session does not do.
Append at whichever of these comes first: before you run a command you expect
to take more than a minute, write down what you are about to run and why; after
any command whose output you will cite, paste that output then rather than
later; at every conclusion you reach, including the ones you go on to discard.
The self-check is one line and you can run it against yourself at any moment:
if you cannot say which tool call your last append followed, you are already
behind, so stop and write.

Two things this buys that a final write-up cannot. A death mid-round leaves a
PARTIAL RESULT rather than nothing, which is the difference between salvage and
total loss. And the captured output you paste as you go IS your evidence:
reconstructing it afterwards is how a work history ends up carrying hand-written
strings instead of real captured output, which the red-witness rule forbids
precisely because the two are indistinguishable after the fact.

Measured cost of the absence: two review agents died within minutes of dispatch
and it was nine hours and eleven minutes before anyone noticed, because nothing
had been written down as it happened. That is the largest single waste this
project has recorded, and the entire loss was wall clock.

WHAT A STALE BEACON COSTS, which the watchdog sentence above implies and does
not state. Staleness is measured against a threshold the supervisor sets and
not one you agree to, and a stale beacon is read as a DEAD AGENT, because from
the outside those two are the same observation. The supervisor is then entitled
to interrupt you, to dispatch a replacement, and to salvage your artifact as it
stands and continue from that. What you had not written down is not handed
over; it is lost, and the work is redone without it. The consequence lands on
the round rather than on you, which is why it is worth more to you to write
than to finish the thought first.

AND THE HONEST LIMIT OF THIS CLAUSE. Nothing here forces the append. This is a
rule you follow, and what the kernel adds is to make the absence VISIBLE and
the consequence real, not to make the omission impossible. The teeth are the
watchdog, which is the supervisor's half in the clause below, so a dispatch
made without one leaves this clause with none. If you are the one dispatching,
arm it in the same turn.

## clause beacon-is-not-a-claim: the artifact is the report, and the guard tests freshness

Do not report progress by asserting it. "Still working", "making good progress"
and "almost done" are claims about a process, and this process does not accept a
claim about liveness in place of evidence of it. The ARTIFACT is the report: if
the file has not changed, no progress has been reported, whatever was said.

This is one half of a rule written from two ends. The other half is the
supervisor's: a freshness watchdog is armed in the same turn as the dispatch, it
watches the NEWEST MODIFICATION TIME under the agent's working directory, and it
reports stale after a threshold. It must test FRESHNESS, never existence and
never completion. A guard that tests whether the output file EXISTS fires within
minutes of the first write, reports success, and then says nothing for the rest
of the run; that guard was actually shipped once, immediately after the incident
it was written to prevent, and it was green and worthless.

The two halves need each other. A watchdog watching freshness needs something
freshening, which is the clause above; and an agent freshening a file needs
something watching, which is the supervisor's duty. Neither half alone reaches
the failure.
